    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value itself. If the dataset has an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is robust to outliers because it is not affected by extreme values.\n",

    "- A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or multiple modes (bimodal, trimodal, etc.).\n",

    "How they are used to measure the central tendency of a dataset:\n",
    "- The mean, median, and mode are used to describe the central tendency or central value of a dataset.\n",
    "- The mean is commonly used when the data is normally distributed and has no significant outliers.\n",
    "- The median is used when the data has skewed distributions or when outliers may affect the mean.\n",
    "- The mode is useful for identifying the most frequent value or category in categorical data.\n",
