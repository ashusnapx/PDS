    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted and an error message is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as attempting to access a file that doesn't exist, dividing by zero, or passing the wrong arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter can't understand the code that you've written. Syntax errors are detected before the program is executed and are usually caused by things like missing brackets, mismatched quotes, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected before the program is executed, whereas exceptions occur during program execution. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, while exceptions can occur during the course of the program's execution.\n",
