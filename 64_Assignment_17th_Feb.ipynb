    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, semi-structured document format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional SQL databases, MongoDB does not require a fixed schema for storing data, making it highly scalable and adaptable to changing data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data that may not fit well in traditional SQL databases. These databases are highly scalable and offer high performance and availability, making them ideal for big data applications and real-time data processing.\n",

    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is semi-structured, complex, or constantly changing. This could include scenarios such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Data Applications - MongoDB is highly scalable and can easily handle large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time Data Processing - MongoDB can store and retrieve data quickly, making it ideal for real-time applications where data needs to be processed and analyzed in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile Development - MongoDB's flexible schema allows for rapid development and iteration, making it ideal for agile software development.\n",

    "Content Management - MongoDB can be used as a content management system, allowing for the storage and retrieval of rich media and other unstructured data.\n",

    "Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in a flexible, semi-structured document format called BSON (Binary JSON), which makes it easier to work with data that doesn't fit well into a traditional relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic schema: MongoDB's schema is dynamic, which means that fields can be added or removed from documents without the need for a predefined schema. This makes it easier to handle data that is constantly changing or evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "High performance: MongoDB is designed for high performance and can handle large volumes of data with ease. It also supports horizontal scaling, allowing it to scale out to handle increasing amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing on any field, making it easy to search for data and retrieve it quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic sharding: MongoDB supports automatic sharding, which means that it can automatically distribute data across multiple servers to improve performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB supports powerful aggregation functions that allow you to analyze and manipulate data in complex ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID transactions: MongoDB supports ACID transactions, which ensure that data is consistent and reliable, even in the face of concurrent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible deployment options: MongoDB can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud, and supports a variety of deployment models, including standalone servers, replica sets, and sharded clusters.\n",
