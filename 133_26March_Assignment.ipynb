    "Linear regression relies on several assumptions to be valid. Here are the key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable should be linear. This means that the change in the mean of the dependent variable should be constant for a unit change in the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Errors**: The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. In other words, the error for one data point should not be influenced by the error of another data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)**: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). This means that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same at all values of the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors**: The errors should be normally distributed. This assumption is about the distribution of the residuals, not the independent or dependent variables themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity**: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. This can make it difficult to separate out the individual effects of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Endogeneity**: The independent variables should not be correlated with the error term. In other words, they should be exogenous.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **No Autocorrelation of Errors**: The errors should not be correlated with each other over time or across observations. This assumption is more relevant in time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checking Assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity**: This can be assessed by visual inspection of scatter plots, or by plotting the residuals against the predicted values. If the relationship is not linear, you might need to consider transformations of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence of Errors**: This can be checked using a plot of residuals against the order of observation. There should be no discernible pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity**: This can be checked by plotting the residuals against the predicted values. A \"funnel\" shape in the plot may indicate heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Errors**: You can use a Q-Q plot to check if the residuals follow a normal distribution. You can also perform statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Multicollinearity**: Calculate the correlation matrix between independent variables. High correlations (close to 1 or -1) may indicate multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **No Endogeneity**: This requires careful consideration of the study design and potential sources of endogeneity. If you suspect endogeneity, you might need to use instrumental variables or other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **No Autocorrelation of Errors**: This is more relevant in time series data. You can use autocorrelation plots or statistical tests like the Durbin-Watson test to check for autocorrelation.\n",

    "It's important to note that violation of these assumptions can lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences. Therefore, it's crucial to assess these assumptions before drawing conclusions from a linear regression model.\n",

    "In a linear regression model, the slope and intercept have specific interpretations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Slope (Coefficient of Independent Variable)**:\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: The slope represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, holding all other variables constant. It quantifies the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If the slope for a regression model predicting salary based on years of experience is 2, it means that, on average, each additional year of experience is associated with a $2 increase in salary, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intercept (Constant Term)**:\n",
    "   - **Interpretation**: The intercept represents the estimated value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. It is often used to account for the baseline value of the dependent variable when the independent variable(s) have no effect.\n",
    "   - **Example**: In the same salary prediction model, if the intercept is $40,000, it means that an individual with zero years of experience (i.e., a new hire) is estimated to have a starting salary of $40,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are working with a dataset of housing prices, and you want to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on its size (in square feet) as the only independent variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{House Price} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Size} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\beta_0\\) (Intercept): This represents the estimated price of a house when its size is zero square feet. In reality, there's no such thing as a house with zero square feet, so this intercept term is often just a mathematical necessity and may not have a meaningful interpretation in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(\\beta_1\\) (Slope): This represents the change in house price for each additional square foot of size. If \\(\\beta_1\\) is, for example, $200, it means that, on average, each additional square foot adds $200 to the estimated price of the house, assuming all other factors (location, condition, etc.) remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have a house that is 2,000 square feet in size and your linear regression model estimates \\(\\beta_0\\) to be $50,000 and \\(\\beta_1\\) to be $200, your model would predict the price of the house as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{House Price} = 50,000 + 200 \\times 2,000 = $450,000 \\]\n",

    "**Gradient Descent** is an iterative optimization algorithm used for finding the minimum of a function. In the context of machine learning, it is commonly used to minimize a loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how gradient descent works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the parameter values. These can be random or set to some predefined values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute the Gradient**: Calculate the gradient (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to each parameter. The gradient gives the direction of steepest ascent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Parameters**: Adjust the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss function. This is done using the following update rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \\[ \\theta = \\theta - \\alpha \\cdot \\nabla L(\\theta) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - \\(\\theta\\) represents the parameter being updated.\n",
    "   - \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate, which determines the size of the steps taken during each iteration.\n",
    "   - \\(\\nabla L(\\theta)\\) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to \\(\\theta\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "   The learning rate is a hyperparameter that you need to tune. Too large a learning rate might cause overshooting, while too small a learning rate might result in slow convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criterion is met. This could be a maximum number of iterations, or until the change in the loss function becomes very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Gradient Descent is Used in Machine Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the goal is to train a model to make accurate predictions. This involves finding the parameters (like weights in a neural network or coefficients in a linear regression) that minimize a loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is used to perform this optimization. The loss function measures the error between predicted and actual values. By iteratively adjusting the model's parameters in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient), we aim to find the parameter values that minimize this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a neural network, the loss function could be the difference between predicted and actual outputs. Gradient descent adjusts the weights and biases in the network to minimize this difference. This process is repeated through many iterations (epochs) until the model converges to a point where further changes in parameters do not significantly reduce the loss.\n",
